 * 
 * @brief Defines the MobileRobotKinematics class, which represents a mobile robot's kinematic system. 
 *        This class encapsulates properties related to the robot's wheels, including their physical dimensions, 
 *        orientation parameters, and velocity information.
 * 
 * The MobileRobotKinematics class includes:
 * - Member variables for wheel properties such as name, radius, and orientation parameters (L, alpha, beta, gamma).
 * - Methods for setting and getting the wheel's target and current velocities.
 * 
 * @class MobileRobotKinematics
 * 
 * @details The MobileRobotKinematics class is designed to handle the basic attributes and functionalities of a mobile robot's 
 *          kinematic framework. It supports operations for managing the robot's wheels' velocities and provides methods for 
 *          accessing their various physical and operational parameters.
