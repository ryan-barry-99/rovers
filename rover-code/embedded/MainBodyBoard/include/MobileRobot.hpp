/**
 * @file MobileRobot.hpp
 * @brief Header file for the MobileRobot class.
 *
 * This file contains the definition of the `MobileRobot` class, which represents a mobile robot
 * equipped with a set of fixed wheels. The class manages the wheels, performs kinematic calculations,
 * and updates the kinematic model as the wheel configuration changes.
 *
 * The `MobileRobot` class:
 * - Manages a collection of `Wheel` objects.
 * - Handles kinematic calculations through the `MobileRobotKinematics` class.
 * - Provides methods to add and remove wheels and update the kinematics model accordingly.
 *
 * Includes:
 * - `MobileRobotKinematics.hpp`: Header for the kinematic calculations related to the robot.
 * - `Wheel.hpp`: Header for the `Wheel` class, representing individual wheels of the robot.
 *
 * Usage:
 * To use this class, instantiate a `MobileRobot` object with a vector of `Wheel` objects. 
 * Utilize the provided methods to manage wheels and perform kinematic calculations as needed.
